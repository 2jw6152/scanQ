# ScanQ

ScanQ is a Flutter application for scanning CSAT-style questions using OCR.

## Development

This project uses the following folders:

- `lib/scanning` – camera and OCR logic
- `lib/parsing` – parsing scanned text into question components
- `lib/saving` – saving extracted questions
- `lib/review` – reviewing saved questions

Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.

Use `flutter run` to launch the app on an Android device or emulator.
